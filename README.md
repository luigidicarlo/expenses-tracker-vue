# Expenses Tracker

A very basic Vue app that allows to track expenses of two types: `Zelle` and `Cash`.

I created this app for my own personal use, although anyone is welcome to extend it or use it in any other way they see fit.

One of the main reasons to build this app was to start my journey using Vue as my main front end framework for building web UIs.

## Components

All components are located in the `src/components` folder, except `App.vue` which is in `src`.

## Other tools

**Expenses Tracker** uses Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome 5 and Poppins font.
